# Rusty Snake

Snake game implemented in Rust. I'm doing this to learn Rust programming language and to try a new domain - game development. And simply for fun! And to code something like in good old times, without any AI support.

## Development how-tos

Install `bacon` to run unit tests on project update:

```bash
cargo install --locked bacon
bacon test
# or
bacon nextest
```

Run `fmt` to format the source code:

```bash
cargo fmt
```
